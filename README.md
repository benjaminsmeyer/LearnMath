# Learn Math

A sample application as we explore MVC.

# Description

The local elementary school needs an app to help their students learn basic addition and subtraction. Youâ€™ve decided to propose an app wherein the student will be presented with 10 randomly generated addition/subtraction problems (all single digit problems with answer >= 0 for now). The problems will be shown to the student one at a time, giving the student time to enter their answer. At the end, the app will show all the problems, the answers given by the student (and the correct answer for any problem they got wrong), and the count of correct and incorrect answers total.
